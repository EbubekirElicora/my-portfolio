# MyPortfolio

Personal Fullstack Developer Portfolio built with Angular, focused on clean architecture, responsive design, and modern web technologies.

## Overview

This project represents my personal developer portfolio.  
It showcases completed projects, architectural decisions, and practical fullstack development skills across frontend and backend.

The application is implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) with a strong focus on:
- clean and consistent UI/UX
- responsive layouts across multiple screen sizes
- structured and maintainable component architecture
- real-world development standards instead of demo patterns

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as a technical overview for:
- recruiters
- development teams
- technical decision-makers

It demonstrates real implementations rather than isolated code examples.

## Tech Stack
